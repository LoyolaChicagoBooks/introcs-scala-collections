The city of Chicago publishes a staggering amount of data that is [freely
accessible online][1], everything from food inspections to crime. It's worth
looking through the list of popular data, I highly recommend it. They even have
their own [GitHub organization][2] with additional data and neat tools they
have developed.

For this lab I thought it would be fun to analyze some of this data, in
particular we are looking at the [total number][3] of riders per day on CTA's
bus routes. Data is available as far back as 2001, and at 14MB it is a bit too
much for our purposes. I have included the repository a CSV (Comma-Separated
Value) file of just the 2014 data.
